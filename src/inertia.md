Inertia is a term in physics. It is the resistance of any physical object to a change in its velocity. However, recently I began to notice similar principles in other spheres of life.

For example, starting a new habit might be extremely hard, but once it becomes an actual habit. Then a person usually performs it unconsciously.

There are other examples: finding a first job might be harder than finding a third one, and earning more money when a person is already rich is much easier than getting out of poverty.

It might be a rough simplification, but things in the world tend to stay the same until an occurrence of some groundbreaking event.
